# AdmissionPrediction


Goal - Create an application where students can know the chances of their admission in college just by entering the exam score and other details.

Solution - Create a regression model based on previous available data (SVM with Hyperparameters tuning in this case) and deploy model on GCP.

Result - We got the test r2 score of 0.7457 which is a decent score for predicting chances of selection in desired college.
